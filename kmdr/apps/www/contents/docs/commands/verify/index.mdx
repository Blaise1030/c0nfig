title: verify
description: The verify command fetches a remote configuration file over HTTP or HTTPS and validates its structure against the c0nfig schema. This is useful for testing configurations before publishing them to ensure they are correctly formed.
---

## Usage

```bash
npx k0nfig@latest verify  <remote-config-url>
```

`<remote-config-url>`is The HTTPS URL pointing to the remote configuration JSON file.

The verify command provides verbose error messages to help you pinpoint exactly where and what the issues are in your configuration.

Suppose your configuration is missing the `targetSrc` field in an add operation:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "remoteSrc": "/templates/README.md"
    // "targetSrc" is missing
  }
]
```

Running the verify command

```bash
npx k0nfig@latest verify https://example.com/invalid-config.json
```

Will give you as such

```bash
Validation failed:
Path: 0 -> targetSrc
  Issue: Required
```
