description: A CLI tool that allows you to create easy, quick, and reusable project configurations.

This project is heavily inspired by Shadcn's CLI approach, which promotes copying and pasting code snippets directly into your apps, rather than including them as dependencies together. It also greatly helps with developer's
workflows by handling updates on a project configurations as well.

This approach strikes an ideal balance between customizability and efficiency.

**c0nfig** aims to empower developers & library maintainers to easily create their own reusable configurations that automates mundane setup tasks.

At c0nfig, we manage the CLI, you create the configuration.

This approach of executing remote configurations simplifies distribution
and updates, ensuring all users have access to the latest configurations without
manual updates on a CLI tool.

Updating configurations or assets can be as simple as updating
the files on your server.

c0nfig simplifies the process of creating reusable project configurations by giving developers a flexible, reusable, and customizable solution.
It will streamline your workflows and improve efficiency.
